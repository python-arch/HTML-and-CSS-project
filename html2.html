        HTML, HyperText Markup Language, gives content structure and meaning by defining that content as, for example, headings, paragraphs, or images. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a presentation language created to style the appearance of content—using, for example, fonts or colors.
        The two languages—HTML and CSS—are independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS should not be written inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always represent the appearance of that content.

        HTML documents are plain text documents saved with an .html file extension rather than a .txt file extension. To begin writing HTML, you first need a plain text editor that you are comfortable using. Sadly this does not include Microsoft Word or Pages, as those are rich text editors. Two of the more popular plain text editors for writing HTML and CSS are Dreamweaver and Sublime Text. Free alternatives also include Notepad++ for Windows and TextWrangler for Mac.
 All HTML documents have a required structure that includes the following declaration and elements: <!DOCTYPE html>,<html>, <head>, and <body>.

        CSS = Style: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) dictate your website’s look and feel.
Font size, font color, font type, styling around images, page layout, mouse-over effects and more are all determined by CSS.
In WordPress, CSS can be edited within the “Editor” section under Appearance in the Dashboard. Some WordPress themes, like Headway, allow you to visually edit the CSS (meaning you don’t need to get eyeball headaches from coding).
The colors, fonts and styles of this entire website are driven by CSS
HTML = Content: HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the building-blocks of web pages.
HTML allows you to put images, text, videos, forms and other pieces of content together into a cohesive webpage. You can also tweak text words, resize images, and add links to either.
Anything that you can read or view on this website is being presented to you (by way of a browser) with HTML.
